      "2-19-98 13:24:18 REC: Log>\" As a conversation takes place between Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), two free humans, a table of random green numbers are being scanned and individual numbers selected, creating a series of digits not unlike an ordinary phone number, as if a code is being deciphered or a call is being traced.\n",
      "Anderson, a software engineer for a Metacortex, the other life as Neo, a computer hacker \"guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.\" Agent Smith asks him to help them capture Morpheus, a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty.\n",
      "Morpheus explains that he's been searching for Neo his entire life and asks if Neo feels like \"Alice in Wonderland, falling down the rabbit hole.\" He explains to Neo that they exist in the Matrix, a false reality that has been constructed for humans to hide the truth.\n",
      "Just before Neo passes out Morpheus says to him, \"Welcome to the real world.\"\n",
      "Neo is introduced to Morpheus's crew including Trinity; Apoc (Julian Arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair; Switch; Cypher (bald with a goatee); two brawny brothers, Tank (Marcus Chong) and Dozer (Anthony Ray Parker); and a young, thin man named Mouse (Matt Doran).\n",
      "\"So, if you die in the Matrix, you die here?\" \"The body cannot live without the mind,\" says Morpheus, underlining the very real danger faced in the simulation.\n",
      "He asks Trinity why, if Morpheus thinks Neo is the One, he hasn't taken him to see the Oracle yet.\n",
      "\"What are you trying to tell me,\" asks Neo, \"That I can dodge bullets?\" \"When you're ready,\" Morpheus says, \"You won't have to.\" Just then Morpheus gets a phone call.\n",
      "Cypher cuts up a juicy steak and ruminates that he knows the steak is merely the simulation telling his brain that it is delicious and juicy, but after nine years he has discovered that \"ignorance is bliss.\" He strikes a deal for the machines to reinsert his body into a power plant, reinsert him into the Matrix, and he'll help the Agents.\n",
      "Morpheus, Trinity, Neo, Apoc, Switch, Mouse and Cypher are jacked into the Matrix.\n",
      "He continues badgering Trinity, asking her if she believes that Neo is the One. She says, \"Yes.\" Cypher screams back \"No!\" but his reaction is incredulity at seeing Tank still alive, brandishing the weapon that Cypher had used on him.\n",
      "Neo says he only knows that he can bring Morpheus out.\n",
      "Morpheus has yet to break and Smith asks the other Agents why the serum isn't working.\n",
      "Agents Brown and Jones enter the interrogation room to find Smith with his hands still fixed on Morpheus's head.\n",
      "Trinity brings the helicopter down to the floor that Morpheus is on and Neo opens fire on the three Agents.\n",
      "Instead of running, which Trinity implores him to do as she looks on from the ship, Neo turns to face Smith.\n",
      "Trinity reminds Morpheus that they can't use the EMP while Neo is in the Matrix.\n",
      "\"I know, Trinity, don't worry,\" says Morpheus, \"He's going to make it.\"\n",
